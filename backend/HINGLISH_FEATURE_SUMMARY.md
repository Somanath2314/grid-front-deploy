# Hinglish Search Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Hinglish search feature that allows users to search using transliterated Hindi words (Hinglish) and receive relevant English product results.

## ✅ Core Functionality Working

### 1. Translation Function
The `translate_hindi_to_english()` function correctly translates Hinglish terms to English:

- **Footwear**: `chappal` → `footwear`, `joota` → `shoes`, `joote` → `shoes`
- **Cleaning**: `jhaadu` → `broom`, `jhaadoo` → `broom`, `jharu` → `broom`, `safai` → `cleaning`
- **Clothing**: `kapde` → `clothing`, `kurta` → `kurta`

### 2. Product Search Integration
The search functionality correctly finds products using Hinglish queries:

- **"chappal"** → finds Bata footwear products
- **"jhaadu"** → finds Bajaj broom products  
- **"kapde"** → finds clothing products
- **"joota"** → finds shoe products

### 3. Mixed Query Support
Complex queries with multiple Hinglish terms work correctly:
- `"chappal shoes"` → `"footwear shoes"`
- `"jhaadu cleaning"` → `"broom cleaning"`
- `"kapde kurta"` → `"clothing kurta"`
